# Projects:
* [mtrc](https://github.com/qaat-org/mtrc) ~ Main test runtime controller
* [tpfo](https://github.com/qaat-org/tpfo) ~ Track process from outside
* [ibtr](https://github.com/qaat-org/ibtr) ~ In browser test recording


All these projects are in early stage of planning,
and the intent of them is for me to learn something new.
If they ever become what the moto states, I'll be very proud.

## Moto:  Create impact, not hype !

# Learning goals:
* Low level programming
* Software scaling and work distribution
* Performant software
* Data analysis at scale

# Quetions to answer:
* UI tests recording that works ?
